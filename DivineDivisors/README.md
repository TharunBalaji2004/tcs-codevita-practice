## Problem Description
Question -: Print a line containing all the divisors in increasing order separated by space.

Input Format: The first line of input contains an integer ‘N’ denoting the number.

Output Format: Print a line containing all the divisors in increasing order separated by space.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^8

S.no	Input	Output	 
1	    10	    1 2 5 10

## Algorithm Analysis

- Naive Approach
    - Time Complexity: O(N)
    - Space Complexity: O(1)

- Better Approach
    - Time Complexity: O(N/2) approx. to O(N)
    - Space Complexity: O(1)
